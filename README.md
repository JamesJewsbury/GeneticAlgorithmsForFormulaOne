# Genetic Algorithms For Formula One

## 💡 Idea
Using a genetic algorithm to optimise the race calendar of the 2024 Formula One season, to minimise the distance travelled and carbon emissions.

## 👷🏻‍♂️ Implementation
The core of the problem is no different to the Travelling Sales Person Problem, we are looking to minimise the total distance travelled, visiting all nodes (races) and with no repetitions.
